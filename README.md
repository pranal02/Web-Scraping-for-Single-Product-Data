# Web-Scraping-for-Single-Product-Data
Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic web scraping process to extract product titles, prices, and ratings from a website. It utilizes the beautifulsoup4 (bs4), pandas, and requests libraries in Python.

Note: Web scraping practices should be respectful of a website's terms of service and robots.txt. Always check and adhere to these guidelines before scraping.

Prerequisites
Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
beautifulsoup4 library (pip install beautifulsoup4)
pandas library (pip install pandas)
requests library (pip install requests)
Steps
Import Libraries:
Python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
Use code with caution.

Define User Agent:

Visit https://www.whatismybrowser.com/ to get your browser's user agent string.
Replace the placeholder below with your actual user agent:
Python
user_agent = "YOUR_USER_AGENT_STRING"
Use code with caution.

Set Up Headers:

Create a dictionary to store the user agent information in the header:
Python
headers = {'User-Agent': user_agent}
Use code with caution.

Target URL:

Replace the following with the actual URL you want to scrape:
Python
target_url = "https://www.example.com/products"
Use code with caution.

Send Request:

Use requests.get to send an HTTP GET request to the target URL with the headers:
Python
response = requests.get(target_url, headers=headers)
Use code with caution.

Check for Successful Response:

Handle potential errors by checking the response status code (200 indicates success):
Python
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Successfully fetched the webpage!")
else:
    print(f"Error: Request failed with status code {response.status_code}")
    exit()
Use code with caution.

Parse HTML Content:

Use BeautifulSoup to parse the downloaded HTML content:
Python
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
